# Anki üå≤üå¥ **TREE** üéÑüå≥ Identification

This is an in-progress deck of flashcards for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), to learn to identify üå≤üå¥ **TREES** üéÑüå≥

The card formats _(Front &#8594; Back)_ are:
 1. Full image &#8594; Common name (and scientific name)
 1. Leaf image &#8594; Common name (and scientific name)
 1. Flower image &#8594; Common name (and scientific name)
 1. Fruit/seed image &#8594; Common name (and scientific name)
 1. Scientific name &#8594; Common name
 1. Common name &#8594; Scientific name

Most notes have all of the above types, but a few are missing appropriate photos for flower, fruit, or seed.

Tweaking or removing any of these card types in Anki is trivial, and this deck aims to encompass most üå≤üå¥ **TREE** üéÑüå≥ enthusiasts' learning desires.

## Usage Instructions

 1. Install the free and open-source flashcard software [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
 1. `Tools` &#8594; `Addons` &#8594; `Get Add-ons`
 1. Paste in the code for the [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) add-on (At time of writing, it's `1788670778`, but be careful to only install add-ons you trust!)
 1. Close and reopen Anki
 1. Unfortunately, I can't get `File` &#8594; `CrowdAnki: Import from Github`, to work, so instead:
 1. Download this repository, either as a zip (unzip it) or using git.
 1. `File` &#8594; `CrowdAnki: Import from Disk`, and navigate to select the download location.

## Contributing

Making high quality identification flash cards is hard, but interesting! This assumes you are already familiar with how Github works, and how Anki works. Here's how to contribute:

 1. Fork this repo on Github, and clone it to your machine
 1. `File` &#8594; `CrowdAnki: Import from Disk`, and navigate to select the download location.
 1. Add a new üå≤üå¥ **TREE** üéÑüå≥ if you don't see its scientific name already in the deck

  > ### üì∑ _**Photo selection**_
  > - Lets keep photos legal and attributed. [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a fantastic place to search for images, and the attribution is straightforward:
  >   - `Use this file on the web` &#8594; `Attribution` &#8594; Check `HTML` &#8594; Copy &#8594; Open the HTML editor in Anki's attribution field (Ctrl+Shift+X) &#8594; Paste.
  > - Photos should represent the typical üå≤üå¥ **TREE** üéÑüå≥, the typical leaves, the typical flower, etc. Better to omit a photo category rather than add an unidentifiable or atypical example.
  > - Whole photos: Try to capture the size and branching pattern of the entire üå≤üå¥ **TREE** üéÑüå≥.
  > - Leaf/flower/seed/fruit photos: Try to capture the size and details of individual leaf/flower/fruit/seed, and the twig or branch structure supporting them.
  > - Avoid photos of stuff not attached to the üå≤üå¥ **TREE** üéÑüå≥ anymore
  > - Avoid photos with distracting details
  > - Contributing your own photos? Go the extra mile and [upload them to Wikimedia first](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Contributing_your_own_work) so they can be easily used and attributed by others!

 4. Export the deck, using the CrowdAnki plugin, overwriting your downloaded git repository.
 1. Check that the changes make sense (`git status` and `git diff`). You should see your new photos and some additions to `deck.json` for every new note you added.
 1. If on Unix, run `./optimize-images.sh` (You need to have Image Magick installed). This will take your new, full-size images and compress them down a little bit, while saving a backup to the `original-size-media` directory. Then you should reimport (see step #2 above) so Anki uses/exports these compressed images instead of the full-quality ones.
 1. `git commit` the changes with a good descriptive commit message, and `git push`. Create a pull request from your fork back to the original repository!
